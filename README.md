## About Me

I am an independent security researcher and former full-stack software engineer.

- 2+ years of experience in Web3 security research  
- 7+ years of experience as a full-stack developer  
- 4+ years of competitive programming background  

My engineering background gives me a deep understanding of how systems work - and how they break. I enjoy exploring complex systems and discovering what lies beneath the obvious.
